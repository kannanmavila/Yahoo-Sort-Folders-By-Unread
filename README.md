# Yahoo! - Sort Folders By Unread
If you have several folders in your Yahoo! inbox, it is tedious to scroll through them every now and then to see if one has unread emails in it. This script periodically checks the folders and sorts them in the descending order of the number of unread emails. All folders with no unread emails in them are left alone as per the original (alphabetical) order.

## How To Install
* Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or an equivalent browser script program
* Restart your browser
* Go to [yahoo-sort-folders-by-unread/main/script.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kannanmavila/yahoo-sort-folders-by-unread/main/script.js) file and it should bring up a popup for installation
  * If not, import the file manually into Tampermonkey
